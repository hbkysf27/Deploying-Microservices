# Deploying Microservices - Azure Kubernetes

This project demonstrates how to develop, containerize, and deploy microservices using Docker Compose and automate the deployment pipeline to Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS). The architecture utilizes ASP.NET Core, Docker, and Azure DevOps to create a scalable and efficient microservices environment.

## Features

- **Microservices Architecture:** A set of loosely coupled services designed for independent scaling and deployment.
- **Containerization:** Each service is containerized using Docker for portability and ease of deployment.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated deployment pipelines for seamless integration and delivery through Azure DevOps.
- **Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS):** Managed Kubernetes service to orchestrate and scale microservices.
- **ASP.NET Core:** Backend services developed using ASP.NET Core for high performance and scalability.

## Technologies

- **Backend:** ASP.NET Core
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Orchestration:** Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)
- **CI/CD:** Azure DevOps
- **Container Management:** Docker Compose

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your local machine
- Azure CLI and an active Azure account
- Kubernetes cluster created on Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)
- Azure DevOps account
- Visual Studio or compatible IDE

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Deploying-Microservices.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd deploying-microservices-aks
   ```

3. **Build Docker images:**
   Build the Docker images for each microservice using the following command:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

4. **Push Docker images to a container registry:**
   Push the built images to a container registry (e.g., Azure Container Registry):
   ```bash
   docker tag your-image-name your-registry-name.azurecr.io/your-image-name
   docker push your-registry-name.azurecr.io/your-image-name
   ```

5. **Deploy to AKS:**
   Deploy the microservices to AKS using the Kubernetes configuration files. Apply the Kubernetes manifests to your cluster:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```

6. **Set up Azure DevOps Pipeline:**
   - Configure a CI pipeline in Azure DevOps for continuous integration and build automation.
   - Set up a CD pipeline for automatic deployment to AKS after the build process completes.

### Usage

- The project demonstrates how microservices can be managed, scaled, and deployed using AKS.
- It automates the containerization process and streamlines the deployment through the use of Azure DevOps pipelines.
- The architecture is designed to scale efficiently, allowing for the addition of more services as needed.
